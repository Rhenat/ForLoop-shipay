==Description==
ShiPay is an online shipping company with a twist. We specialize in handling the shipments of users who do not have access to a physical shipping address in Ghana. Individuals can sign up with use and access a shipping address at a fee to use on whichever e-commerce portal they choose. We will make sure their goods arrive safely, upon which they can come and clear their goods(also at a fee).

==UI/UX==
Users get on our website and sign up or if they already have an account they login. The Login sends the user to their Profile page, where the user can add a new transaction or just view the records of previous and pending transactions.
We at ShiPay are able to identify a customer's package using their shipment tracking number they provide during the transaction process as well a unique OrderID we automatically give them once they add a new transcation.


==APIs==
This program employed the Rave API by Flutterwave in our product. This allows payment for our services by credit card or mobile money transfer.
We also incorporated the Africa's talking SMS API to communicate with customers on receipt of their payment and also on receipt of their shipment.
